                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>"position: sticky;" and "position: -webkit-sticky;"</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>"top: 120px;" and "left: 40px". Changing the top and left property values moves the box by the number of pixels specified in order to give the left and top the correct amount of spacing based on its original position.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>"top: 90px;" and "right: 10px;". Changing the top and right property values sets where the box sits on the screen. The box does not move when the user scrolls.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>"bottom: 20px;" and "right: 20px". Changing the bottom and right property values places the box based on those margins inside of its parent element.</p>
